## Rinkeby Testing

**Rinkeby faucet for sAPE:**
[Lives here](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x800B3d87b77361F0D1d903246cA1F51b5acb43c9#writeContract), to retrieve test sAPE click `Connect to Web3` and use function #3: `dripSAPE`. After connecting to web3, click `Write` to execute and 10 sAPE will automatically be transferred to your connected wallet.

Note: The faucet is limited to one transfer per wallet every 6500 blocks (~1 day)

**Rinkeby faucet for WETH:**
[Wrap rinkeby eth on rinkeby uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)

**Rinkeby faucets for LUSD, FRAX & DAI can be taken from rinkeby etherscan:**

1. Go to `src/helpers/AllBonds.ts`
2. then copy the rinkeby `reserveAddress` for the applicable bond & navigate to that contract on rinkeby etherscan.
3. On Rinkeby etherscan use the `mint` function. You can use the number helper for 10^18 & then add four more zeros for 10,000 units of whichever reserve you are minting.

## Architecture/Layout

The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container.

The files/folder structure are a **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Auto deployed on [Fleek.co](http://fleek.co/) fronted by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Since it is hosted via IPFS there is no running "server" component and we don't have server sided business logic. Users are served an `index.html` and javascript to run our applications.

_**TODO**: TheGraph implementation/how/why we use it._
